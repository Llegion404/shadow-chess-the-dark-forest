# Shadow Chess: The Dark Forest

A horror-strategy game based on imperfect information.

## Concept

You cannot see the opponent's pieces. You can only see the squares your pieces currently threaten (Line of Sight).

## Key Features

- **Fog of War:** Line-of-sight visibility based on piece threat zones
- **Echolocation:** Visual pulses reveal enemy positions temporarily when pieces move
- **Ambushes:** No check warnings - you only know when you're attacked
- **Ghost Movement:** One silent movement per game with no pulse
- **Assassination Objective:** Hunt the disguised King among decoy pawns
